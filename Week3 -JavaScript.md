# **Week 3: JavaScript Basics & Advanced Concepts**

## **Goal**
To build a **solid foundation** in JavaScript by covering both **basic and advanced topics**, ensuring hands-on practice, and providing **hints** to avoid roadblocks. The intern will complete **two learning sessions per day**, followed by an **at-home exercise** for reinforcement to maintain continuous engagement.

## **ðŸ“… Day 1: JavaScript Syntax, Variables & Operators**

### **Concepts to Learn**
- Setting up JavaScript (`<script>` tag & `console.log()`) ([W3Schools: JavaScript Introduction](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_intro.asp))
- Declaring variables (`var`, `let`, `const`) and their scope ([MDN: Variables](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Grammar_and_types#variables))
- Understanding Hoisting ([MDN: Hoisting](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Hoisting))
- Primitive data types (`String`, `Number`, `Boolean`, `Null`, `Undefined`, `Symbol`, `BigInt`)
- Type coercion & conversions ([W3Schools: JavaScript Type Conversion](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_type_conversion.asp))

ðŸ’¡ **Hint:** Use `typeof` to check data types in the console. **Be careful!** `typeof null` returns `"object"`â€”this is a JavaScript bug!

### **Concepts to Learn**
- Arithmetic Operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `**`)
- Comparison Operators (`==`, `===`, `!=`, `!==`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`)
- Logical Operators (`&&`, `||`, `!`)
- Assignment Operators (`=`, `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`)
- Ternary Operator ([MDN: Conditional Operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Conditional_Operator))

ðŸ’¡ **Hint:** `===` is strict equality, while `==` does type conversion before comparison. **Avoid `==` unless necessary!**

### **Home Exercise**
- Swap two numbers without using a third variable.
- Convert a string to a number and vice versa using JavaScript functions.
- Use the ternary operator to check if a number is even or odd.
