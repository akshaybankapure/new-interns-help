# **Example Project: Creating a Mini Database Using Dictionaries & JSON Storage**

## **Goal**
To implement a fully functional **mini-database** that supports CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, stores data persistently using JSON, incorporates **security measures**, and is **optimized for scalability and cloud deployment**.

---

## **📌 Project Overview**
### **Objective:**
Develop a modular, CLI-based mini-database system that can handle structured data storage using Python dictionaries and persist data using JSON files.

### **Features:**
✅ Store, retrieve, update, and delete structured records.
✅ Secure storage with encryption.
✅ Indexing for faster lookups.
✅ Backup & restore functionality.
✅ Cloud storage integration (optional bonus: AWS S3/Google Drive backup).
✅ Performance optimizations for handling large datasets.

## **📌 How Each Module Works**

### **1. `database.py` - Core CRUD Operations** ([Learn More](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_functions.asp))
Handles database transactions such as adding, retrieving, updating, and deleting records.

```python
import storage

def add_record(data):
    records = storage.load_data()
    record_id = str(len(records) + 1)
    records[record_id] = data
    storage.save_data(records)
    return record_id
```

---

### **2. `storage.py` - JSON-Based Persistent Storage** ([Learn More](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_json.asp))
Handles reading/writing data to a JSON file.
```python
import json

def load_data():
    try:
        with open("data.json", "r") as f:
            return json.load(f)
    except FileNotFoundError:
        return {}

def save_data(data):
    with open("data.json", "w") as f:
        json.dump(data, f, indent=4)
```

---

### **3. `security.py` - Encryption & Data Integrity** ([Learn More](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cryptography_with_python/cryptography_with_python_quick_guide.htm))
Encrypts data before storing it and decrypts it upon retrieval.
```python
from cryptography.fernet import Fernet

KEY = Fernet.generate_key()
cipher = Fernet(KEY)

def encrypt(data):
    return cipher.encrypt(data.encode()).decode()

def decrypt(data):
    return cipher.decrypt(data.encode()).decode()
```

---

### **4. `indexing.py` - Fast Data Lookup** ([Learn More](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_structures_algorithms/quick_guide.htm))
Implements a simple indexing system for faster searches.
```python
import storage

def create_index(field):
    data = storage.load_data()
    index = {entry[field]: entry for entry in data.values() if field in entry}
    return index
```

---

### **5. `cloud_backup.py` - Cloud Storage Integration**
Allows backups to AWS S3 or Google Drive.
#### **What is AWS S3?** ([AWS Documentation](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/))
AWS S3 (Simple Storage Service) is a cloud-based object storage service that allows applications to store and retrieve large amounts of data efficiently.

#### **What is Google Drive API?** ([Google Docs](https://developers.google.com/drive))
Google Drive API allows applications to upload, download, and manage files in Google Drive, making it useful for cloud backups.

```python
import boto3

def backup_to_s3():
    s3 = boto3.client('s3')
    s3.upload_file("data.json", "your-bucket-name", "backup.json")
```

---

## **⚡ Performance Optimization Techniques** ([Learn More](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_performance.asp))
🔹 Use **Indexing** to speed up search queries.
🔹 Implement **batch writes** instead of writing to JSON for every change.
🔹 Use **threading** for handling concurrent requests.
🔹 Optimize JSON handling by **compression techniques**.

---

## **🌐 Deployment & Cloud Integration**
To make this a real-world application, integrate it with:
- **AWS Lambda + API Gateway** for serverless execution ([AWS Lambda Guide](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/)).
- **Docker** to containerize and deploy ([Docker Docs](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/)).
- **AWS S3/Google Drive** for backups ([AWS S3 Docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/Welcome.html), [Google Drive API](https://developers.google.com/drive)).
- **Flask API** to make it accessible as a microservice ([Flask Guide](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/)).

---

## **📜 Final Git Tasks**
🔹 **Create a branch** `feature-mini-db` and implement features in stages.
🔹 **Commit modular changes** separately (CRUD, security, indexing, cloud backup).
🔹 **Merge & document everything** clearly in the `README.md`.

This example python project covers **database handling, security, performance optimizations, and cloud integration**, providing an **end-to-end** development experience. 🚀
